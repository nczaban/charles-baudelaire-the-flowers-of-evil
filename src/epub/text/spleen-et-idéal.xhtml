		 <span epub:type="subtitle">Benediction</span></h3>
	 <p>
		 <span>When by an edict of the powers supreme</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>A poet’s born into this world’s drab space,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>His mother starts, in horror, to blaspheme</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Clenching her fists at God, who grants her grace.</span>
	 </p>
	 <p>
		 <span>“Would that a nest of vipers I’d aborted</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Rather than this absurd abomination.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Cursed by the night of pleasures vainly sported</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>On which my womb conceived my expiation.</span>
	 </p>
	 <p>
		 <span>Since of all women I am picked by You</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>To be my Mate’s aversion and his shame:</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And since I cannot, like a <i xml:lang="fr">billet-doux</i>,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Consign this stunted monster to the flame,</span>
	 </p>
	 <p>
		 <span>I’ll turn the hatred, which You load on me,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>On the curst tool through which You work your spite,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And twist and stunt this miserable tree</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Until it cannot burgeon for the blight.”</span>
	 </p>
	 <p>
		 <span>She swallows down the white froth of her ire</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And, knowing naught of schemes that are sublime,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Deep in Gehanna, starts to lay the pyre</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>That’s consecrated to maternal crime.</span>
	 </p>
	 <p>
		 <span>Yet with an unseen Angel for protector</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The outcast waif grows drunken with the sun,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And finds ambrosia, too, and rosy nectar</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>In all he eats or drinks, suspecting none.</span>
	 </p>
	 <p>
		 <span>He sings upon his <i xml:lang="it">Via Crucis</i>, plays</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>With winds, and with the clouds exchanges words:</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The Spirit following his pilgrim-ways</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Weeps to behold him gayer than the birds.</span>
	 </p>
	 <p>
		 <span>Those he would love avoid him as in fear,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Or, growing bold to see one so resigned,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Compete to draw from him a cry or tear,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And test on him the fierceness of their kind.</span>
	 </p>
	 <p>
		 <span>In food or drink that’s destined for his taste</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>They mix saliva foul with cinders black,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Drop what he’s touched with hypocrite distaste,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And blame themselves for walking in his track.</span>
	 </p>
	 <p>
		 <span>His wife goes crying in the public way</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>—“Since fair enough he finds me to adore,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The part of ancient idols I will play</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And gild myself with coats of molten ore.</span>
	 </p>
	 <p>
		 <span>I will get drunk on incense, myrrh, and nard,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>On genuflexions, meat, and heady wine.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Out of his crazed and wondering regard,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>I’ll laugh to steal prerogatives divine.</span>
	 </p>
	 <p>
		 <span>When by such impios farces bored at length,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>I’ll place my frail strong hand on him, and start,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>With nails like those of harpies in their strength,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>To plough myself a pathway to his heart.</span>
	 </p>
	 <p>
		 <span>Like a young bird that trembles palpitating,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>I’ll wrench his heart, all crimson, from his chest,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And to my favourite beast, his hunger sating,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Will fling it in the gutter with a jest.”</span>
	 </p>
	 <p>
		 <span>Skyward, to where he sees a Throne blaze splendid,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The pious Poet lifts his arms on high,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And the vast lightnings of his soul extended</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Blot out the crowds and tumults from his eye.</span>
	 </p>
	 <p>
		 <span>“Blessèd be You, O God, who give us pain,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>As cure for our impurity and wrong⁠—</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Essence that primes the stalwart to sustain</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Seraphic raptures that were else too strong.</span>
	 </p>
	 <p>
		 <span>I know that for the Poet You’ve a post,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Where the blest Legions take their ranks and stations,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Invited to the revels with the host</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Of Virtues, Powers, and Thrones, and Dominations.</span>
	 </p>
	 <p>
		 <span>That grief’s the sole nobility, I know it,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Where neither Earth nor Hell can make attacks,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And that, to deck my mystic crown of poet,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>All times and universes paid their tax.</span>
	 </p>
	 <p>
		 <span>But all the gems from old Palmyra lost,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The ores unmixed, the pearls of the abyss,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Set by Your hand, could not suffice the cost</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Of such a blazing diadem as this.</span>
	 </p>
	 <p>
		 <span>Because it will be only made of light,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Drawn from the hearth of the essential rays,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>To which our mortal eyes, when burning bright,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Are but the tarnished mirrors that they glaze.”</span>
