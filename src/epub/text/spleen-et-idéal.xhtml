	   </h4>
	   <p>
		 <span>When by an edict of the powers supreme</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>A poet’s born into this world’s drab space,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>His mother starts, in horror, to blaspheme</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Clenching her fists at God, who grants her grace.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>“Would that a nest of vipers I’d aborted</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Rather than this absurd abomination.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Cursed be the night of pleasures vainly sported</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>On which my womb conceived my expiation.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Since of all women I am picked by You</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>To be my Mate’s aversion and his shame:</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And since I cannot, like a <i xml:lang="fr">billet-doux</i>,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Consign this stunted monster to the flame,</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>I’ll turn the hatred, which You load on me,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>On the curst tool through which You work your spite,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And twist and stunt this miserable tree</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Until it cannot burgeon for the blight.”</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>She swallows down the white froth of her ire</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And, knowing naught of schemes that are sublime,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Deep in Gehenna, starts to lay the pyre</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>That’s consecrated to maternal crime.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Yet with an unseen Angel for protector</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The outcast waif grows drunken with the sun,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And finds ambrosia, too, and rosy nectar</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>In all he eats or drinks, suspecting none.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>He sings upon his <i xml:lang="it">Via Crucis</i>, plays</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>With winds, and with the clouds exchanges words:</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The Spirit following his pilgrim-ways</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Weeps to behold him gayer than the birds.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Those he would love avoid him as in fear,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Or, growing bold to see one so resigned,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Compete to draw from him a cry or tear,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And test on him the fierceness of their kind.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>In food or drink that’s destined for his taste</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>They mix saliva foul with cinders black,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Drop what he’s touched with hypocrite distaste,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And blame themselves for walking in his track.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>His wife goes crying in the public way</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>—“Since fair enough he finds me to adore,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The part of ancient idols I will play</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And gild myself with coats of molten ore.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>I will get drunk on incense, myrrh, and nard,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>On genuflexions, meat, and heady wine.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Out of his crazed and wondering regard,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>I’ll laugh to steal prerogatives divine.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>When by such impios farces bored at length,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>I’ll place my frail strong hand on him, and start,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>With nails like those of harpies in their strength,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>To plough myself a pathway to his heart.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Like a young bird that trembles palpitating,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>I’ll wrench his heart, all crimson, from his chest,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And to my favourite beast, his hunger sating,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Will fling it in the gutter with a jest.”</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Skyward, to where he sees a Throne blaze splendid,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The pious Poet lifts his arms on high,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And the vast lightnings of his soul extended</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Blot out the crowds and tumults from his eye.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>“Blessèd be You, O God, who give us pain,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>As cure for our impurity and wrong⁠—</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Essence that primes the stalwart to sustain</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Seraphic raptures that were else too strong.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>I know that for the Poet You’ve a post,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Where the blest Legions take their ranks and stations,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Invited to the revels with the host</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Of Virtues, Powers, and Thrones, and Dominations.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>That grief’s the sole nobility, I know it,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Where neither Earth nor Hell can make attacks,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And that, to deck my mystic crown of poet,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>All times and universes paid their tax.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>But all the gems from old Palmyra lost,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The ores unmixed, the pearls of the abyss,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Set by Your hand, could not suffice the cost</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Of such a blazing diadem as this.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Because it will be only made of light,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Drawn from the hearth of the essential rays,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>To which our mortal eyes, when burning bright,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Are but the tarnished mirrors that they glaze.”</span>

	   <p>
		 <span>Sometimes for sport the men of loafing crews</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Snare the great albatrosses of the deep,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The indolent companions of their cruise</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>As through the bitter vastitudes they sweep.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Scarce have they fished aboard these airy kings</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>When helpless on such unaccustomed floors,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>They piteously droop their huge white wings</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And trail them at their sides like drifting oars.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>How comical, how ugly, and how meek</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Appears this soarer of celestial snows!</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>One, with his pipe, teases the golden beak,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>One, limping, mocks the cripple as he goes.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>The Poet, like this monarch of the clouds,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Despising archers, rides the storm elate.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>But, stranded on the earth to jeering crowds,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The great wings of the giant baulk his gait.</span>

	   <p>
		 <span>My spirit! with agility you move</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Like a strong swimmer with the seas to fight,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Through the blue vastness furrowing your groove</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>With an ineffable and male delight.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Far from these foetid marshes, be made pure</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>In the pure air of the superior sky,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And drink, like some most exquisite liqueur,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The fire that fills the lucid realms on high.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Beyond where cares or boredom hold dominion,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Which charge our fogged existence with their spleen,</span>

		 <span>Can seek those fields so shining and serene:</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Whose thoughts, like larks, rise on the freshening breeze,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Who fans the morning with his tameless wings,</span>

		 <span>Skims over life, and understands with ease</span>

		 <span>The speech of flowers and other voiceless things.</span>

	   <h4 epub:type="z3998:roman">V</h4>
	   <p>
		 <span>I love the thought of those old naked days</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>When Phoebus gilded torsos with his rays,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>When men and women sported, strong and fleet,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Without anxiety or base deceit,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And heaven caressed them, amorously keen</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>To prove the health of each superb machine.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Cybele then was lavish of her guerdon</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And did not find her sons too gross a burden:</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>But, like a she-wolf, in her love great-hearted,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Her full brown teats to all the world imparted.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Bold, handsome, strong Man, rightly, might evince</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Pride in the glories that proclaimed him prince—</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Fruits pure of outrage, by the blight unsmitten,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>With firm, smooth flesh that cried out to be bitten.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Today the Poet, when he would assess</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Those native splendours in the nakedness</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Of man or woman, feels a sombre chill</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Enveloping his spirit and his will.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>He meets a gloomy picture, which he loathes,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Wherin deformity cries out for clothes.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Oh comic runts! of horror of burlesque!</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Lank, flabby, skewed, pot-bellied, and grotesque!</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Whom their smug god, Utility (poor brats!)</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Has swaddled in his brazen clouts "ersatz"</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>As with cheap tinsel. Women tallow-pale,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Both gnawed and nourished by debauch, who trail</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The heavy burden of maternal vice,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Or of fecundity the hideous price.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>We have (corrupted nations) it is true</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Beauties the ancient people never knew—</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Sad faces gnawed by cancers of the heart</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And charms which morbid lassitudes impart.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>But these inventions of our tardy muse</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Can't force our ailing peoples to refuse</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Just tribute to the holiness of youth</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>With its straightforward mien, its forhead couth,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The limpid gaze, like running water brigh,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Diffusing, careless, through all things, like the light</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Of azure skies, the birds, the winds, the flowers,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The songs, and perfumes, and heart-warming powers.</span>

		 <span>Rubens, the grove of ease, Nepenthe's river</span>

		 <span>Couch of cool flesh, where Love may never be,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>But where life ever flows and seems to quiver</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>As air in heaven, or, in the sea, the sea.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Da Vinci, dusky mirror and profound,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Where angels, smiling mystery, appear,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Shaded by pines and glaciers, that surround</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And seem to shut their country in the rear.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Rembrandt, sad hospital of murmurs, where</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Adorned alone by one great crucifix,</span>

		 <span>From offal-heaps exhales the weeping prayer</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>That winter shoots a sunbeam to transfix.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Vague region, Michaelangelo, where Titans</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Are mixed with Christs: and strong ghosts rise, in crowds, </span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>To stand bold upright in the gloom that lightens,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>With gristly talons tearing through their shrouds.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Rage of the boxer, mischief of the faun,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Extracting beauty out of blackguards' looks—</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The heart how proud, the man how pinched and drawn—</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Puget the mournful emperor of crooks!</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Watteau, the carnival, where famous hearts</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Go flitting by like butterflies that burn,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>While through gay scenes each chandelier imparts</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>A madness to the dancers as they turn.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Goya's a nightmare full of things unguessed,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Of foeti stewed on nights of witches' revels.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Crones ogle mirrors; children scarcely dressed,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Adjust their hose to tantalise the devils.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>A lake of gore where fallen angels dwell</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Is Delacroix, by firwoods ever fair,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Where under fretful skies strange fanfares swell</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Like Weber's sighs and heartbeats in the air.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>These curses, blasphemies, and lamentations,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>These ecstasies, tears, cries and soaring psalms—</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Through endless mazes, their reverberations</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Bring, to our mortal hearts, divinest balms.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>A thousand sentinels repeat the cry.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>A thousand trumpets echo. Beacon-tossed</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>A thousand summits flare it through the sky,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>A call of hunters in the jungle lost.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>And certainly this is the most sublime</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Proof of our worth and value, Oh Divinity,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>That this great sob rolls on through ageless time</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>To die upon the shores of your infinity.</span>
