	   </h4>
	   <p>
		 <span>When by an edict of the powers supreme</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>A poet’s born into this world’s drab space,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>His mother starts, in horror, to blaspheme</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Clenching her fists at God, who grants her grace.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>“Would that a nest of vipers I’d aborted</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Rather than this absurd abomination.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Cursed be the night of pleasures vainly sported</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>On which my womb conceived my expiation.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Since of all women I am picked by You</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>To be my Mate’s aversion and his shame:</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And since I cannot, like a <i xml:lang="fr">billet-doux</i>,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Consign this stunted monster to the flame,</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>I’ll turn the hatred, which You load on me,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>On the curst tool through which You work your spite,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And twist and stunt this miserable tree</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Until it cannot burgeon for the blight.”</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>She swallows down the white froth of her ire</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And, knowing naught of schemes that are sublime,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Deep in Gehenna, starts to lay the pyre</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>That’s consecrated to maternal crime.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Yet with an unseen Angel for protector</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The outcast waif grows drunken with the sun,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And finds ambrosia, too, and rosy nectar</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>In all he eats or drinks, suspecting none.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>He sings upon his <i xml:lang="it">Via Crucis</i>, plays</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>With winds, and with the clouds exchanges words:</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The Spirit following his pilgrim-ways</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Weeps to behold him gayer than the birds.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Those he would love avoid him as in fear,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Or, growing bold to see one so resigned,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Compete to draw from him a cry or tear,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And test on him the fierceness of their kind.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>In food or drink that’s destined for his taste</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>They mix saliva foul with cinders black,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Drop what he’s touched with hypocrite distaste,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And blame themselves for walking in his track.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>His wife goes crying in the public way</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>—“Since fair enough he finds me to adore,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The part of ancient idols I will play</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And gild myself with coats of molten ore.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>I will get drunk on incense, myrrh, and nard,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>On genuflexions, meat, and heady wine.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Out of his crazed and wondering regard,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>I’ll laugh to steal prerogatives divine.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>When by such impios farces bored at length,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>I’ll place my frail strong hand on him, and start,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>With nails like those of harpies in their strength,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>To plough myself a pathway to his heart.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Like a young bird that trembles palpitating,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>I’ll wrench his heart, all crimson, from his chest,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And to my favourite beast, his hunger sating,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Will fling it in the gutter with a jest.”</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Skyward, to where he sees a Throne blaze splendid,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The pious Poet lifts his arms on high,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And the vast lightnings of his soul extended</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Blot out the crowds and tumults from his eye.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>“Blessèd be You, O God, who give us pain,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>As cure for our impurity and wrong⁠—</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Essence that primes the stalwart to sustain</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Seraphic raptures that were else too strong.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>I know that for the Poet You’ve a post,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Where the blest Legions take their ranks and stations,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Invited to the revels with the host</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Of Virtues, Powers, and Thrones, and Dominations.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>That grief’s the sole nobility, I know it,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Where neither Earth nor Hell can make attacks,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And that, to deck my mystic crown of poet,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>All times and universes paid their tax.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>But all the gems from old Palmyra lost,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The ores unmixed, the pearls of the abyss,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Set by Your hand, could not suffice the cost</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Of such a blazing diadem as this.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Because it will be only made of light,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Drawn from the hearth of the essential rays,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>To which our mortal eyes, when burning bright,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Are but the tarnished mirrors that they glaze.”</span>

		 <span>Sometimes for sport the men of loafing crews</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Snare the great albatrosses of the deep,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The indolent companions of their cruise</span>

	   <p>
		 <span>Scarce have they fished aboard these airy kings</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>When helpless on such unaccustomed floors,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>They piteously droop their huge white wings</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And trail them at their sides like drifting oars.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>How comical, how ugly, and how meek</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Appears this soarer of celestial snows!</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>One, with his pipe, teases the golden beak,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>One, limping, mocks the cripple as he goes.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>The Poet, like this monarch of the clouds,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Despising archers, rides the storm elate.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>But, stranded on the earth to jeering crowds,</span>

		 <span>The great wings of the giant baulk his gait.</span>

		 <span>Far from these foetid marshes, be made pure</span>

	   <h4 epub:type="z3998:roman">V</h4>
	   <p>
		 <span>I love the thought of those old naked days</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>When Phoebus gilded torsos with his rays,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>When men and women sported, strong and fleet,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Without anxiety or base deceit,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And heaven caressed them, amorously keen</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>To prove the health of each superb machine.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Cybele then was lavish of her guerdon</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And did not find her sons too gross a burden:</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>But, like a she-wolf, in her love great-hearted,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Her full brown teats to all the world imparted.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Bold, handsome, strong Man, rightly, might evince</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Pride in the glories that proclaimed him prince—</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Fruits pure of outrage, by the blight unsmitten,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>With firm, smooth flesh that cried out to be bitten.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Today the Poet, when he would assess</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Those native splendours in the nakedness</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Of man or woman, feels a sombre chill</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Enveloping his spirit and his will.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>He meets a gloomy picture, which he loathes,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Wherin deformity cries out for clothes.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Oh comic runts! of horror of burlesque!</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Lank, flabby, skewed, pot-bellied, and grotesque!</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Whom their smug god, Utility (poor brats!)</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Has swaddled in his brazen clouts "ersatz"</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>As with cheap tinsel. Women tallow-pale,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Both gnawed and nourished by debauch, who trail</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The heavy burden of maternal vice,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Or of fecundity the hideous price.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>We have (corrupted nations) it is true</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Beauties the ancient people never knew—</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Sad faces gnawed by cancers of the heart</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And charms which morbid lassitudes impart.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>But these inventions of our tardy muse</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Can't force our ailing peoples to refuse</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Just tribute to the holiness of youth</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>With its straightforward mien, its forhead couth,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The limpid gaze, like running water brigh,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Diffusing, careless, through all things, like the light</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Of azure skies, the birds, the winds, the flowers,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The songs, and perfumes, and heart-warming powers.</span>

	   </p>

		 <span>Da Vinci, dusky mirror and profound,</span>

		 <span>Vague region, Michaelangelo, where Titans</span>

		 <br/>

	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Rage of the boxer, mischief of the faun,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Extracting beauty out of blackguards' looks—</span>

		 <span>Puget the mournful emperor of crooks!</span>

		 <span>Watteau, the carnival, where famous hearts</span>

		 <br/>
		 <span>A madness to the dancers as they turn.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Goya's a nightmare full of things unguessed,</span>

		 <span>Of foeti stewed on nights of witches' revels.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Crones ogle mirrors; children scarcely dressed,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Adjust their hose to tantalise the devils.</span>

	   <p>
		 <span>A lake of gore where fallen angels dwell</span>

		 <span>Where under fretful skies strange fanfares swell</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Like Weber's sighs and heartbeats in the air.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>These curses, blasphemies, and lamentations,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>These ecstasies, tears, cries and soaring psalms—</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Through endless mazes, their reverberations</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Bring, to our mortal hearts, divinest balms.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>A thousand sentinels repeat the cry.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>A thousand trumpets echo. Beacon-tossed</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>A thousand summits flare it through the sky,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>A call of hunters in the jungle lost.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>And certainly this is the most sublime</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Proof of our worth and value, Oh Divinity,</span>

		 <br/>
		 <span>And spade and rake must toil the land to save,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>That fragments of my flooded fields be sought</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>From where the water sluices out a grave.</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Who knows if the new flowers my dreams prefigure,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>In this washed soil should find, as by a sluit,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>The mystic nourishment to give them vigour?</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Time swallows up our life, O ruthless rigour!</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And the dark foe that nibbles our heart's root,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Grows on our blood the stronger and the bigger!</span>

		 <span>When first Theology in her young prime</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Flourished with vigour, in that wonderous time,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Of an illustrious Doctor it was said</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>That, having forced indifferent hearts to shed</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Tears of emotion, moved to depths profound:</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And having to celestial glory found</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Marvellous paths, to his own self unknown,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Where only purest souls had fared alone—</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Like a man raised too high, as in a panic,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Crazed with a vertigo of pride satanic,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>He cried "Poor Christ, I've raised you to renown!</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>But had I wished to bring you crashing down</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Probing your flaws, your shame would match your pride</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And you'd be but a foetus to deride!"</span>
	   </p>
	   <p>
		 <span>Immediately he felt his wits escape,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>That flash of sunlight veiled itself in crêpe.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>All chaos through his intellect was rolled,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>A temple once, containing hoards of gold,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>By opulence and order well controlled,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And topped with ceilings splendid to behold.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Silence and night installed their reign in him.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>It seemed he was a cellar dank and dim,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>To which no living man could find the key;</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And from that day a very beast was he.</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>And while he wandered senseless on his way,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Not knowing spring from summer, night from day,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>Foul, dirty, useless, and with no hereafter,</span>
		 <br/>
		 <span>He served the children as a butt for laughter.</span>
